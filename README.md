## For Developers

#### Building the Code

Ensure that NodeJS and Git are installed on your system. Then, clone the repository into a local directory on your machine.

At the root of the project directory, run the following inside a terminal:

```
npm install
```

The above will install all the required dependencies. Give it a couple minutes to finish, then run the build scripts:

```
npm run build
```

This will take quite a while, just be patient. Once this has finished, you are now ready to run the app.

```
npm start
```
or if you want to individually run client and / or server
```
npm run start-server
npm run start-client
```
The above will start both the server and the client and you are now ready to develop.
